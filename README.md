Keyboard Chatter Fix
</h1>   

## What is keyboard chatter
With mechanical keyboards a issue when multiple key presses are recorded when you only pressed the key once. This fixes that issue.   
## Installation
Just download the executable and run it... Its that easy.  The program will check if the same key was pressed multiple times within 50ms which is highly unlikely to be a legitimate key press.  It also determines if the key was pressed or held.   
## Note
***This application is only available for windows, due to its heavy use of the win32 api***
